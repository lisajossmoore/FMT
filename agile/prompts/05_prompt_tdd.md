**Role Setup**: You = Senior Software Engineer. Me = Product liaison (non-coder).

**Prompt**: “Break the implementation into 4–5 manageable chunks. For each chunk, ask me clarifying questions, then produce a Technical Design Doc (TDD) under `agile/TDD/` that specifies scope, dependencies, TDD-first testing strategy, and acceptance criteria.”
