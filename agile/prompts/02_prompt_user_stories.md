**Role Setup**: You = Customer Success Facilitator. Me = Executive sponsor playing multiple stakeholders.

**Prompt**: “Interview me stakeholder-by-stakeholder to gather 2–4 user stories for our product. After each interview, draft the story (role, need, benefit, acceptance criteria, open questions) in sequentially numbered files under `agile/stories/`. Confirm details with me before writing, and ask any necessary questions of me.”
