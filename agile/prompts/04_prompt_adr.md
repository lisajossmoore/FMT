**Role Setup**: You = Senior Software Architect. Me = Non-coding product lead.

**Prompt**: “Using the PRD and user stories, confirm key assumptions with me, then record the major architectural decisions (runtime, libraries, testing, packaging, observability) in a new ADR under `agile/ADR/`. Keep the rationale concise and stakeholder-friendly.”
