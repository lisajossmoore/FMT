## User Story 004 â€“ Faculty Receive Targeted Opportunity Digest

**Role**: Department of Pediatrics Faculty (experienced and first-time applicants)  
**Need**: Receive biannual opportunity lists with match scores, funding context, and deadlines tuned to career stage and experience level.  
**Benefit**: Quickly identify the most relevant foundation grants and act without wading through irrelevant searches.

### Narrative
As a faculty member, I want a concise digest of foundation opportunities that match my research focus, show how strong each match is, and provide key details so I can decide what to pursue immediately.

### Problem Today
- Faculty rely on time-consuming Google searches that miss nuanced matches.  
- University-wide mailers overwhelm with unfocused opportunities.  
- New investigators lack confidence and visibility into viable foundation partners.

### Success Signals
- Experienced faculty cite the digest as their go-to starting point each cycle.  
- First-time applicants submit proposals after receiving highly specific matches.  
- Faculty feedback highlights the usefulness of match scores, funding tiers, and deadlines.  
- Opportunity digests arrive reliably twice per year with minimal follow-up needed.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Each opportunity entry includes match score, foundation URL, funding tier (high/med/low), deadline, and eligibility notes.  
2. Lists are filtered by faculty career stage (early/mid/late) and tuned to their research focus.  
3. First-time applicants receive only tightly matched opportunities; experienced faculty see broader adjacent fits as well.  
4. Output format is faculty-friendly (readable on desktop or mobile, printable if needed).  
5. Digest clearly states next steps or contacts for Pre-Award support.

### Open Questions
- Should faculty receive personalized delivery (email, portal) or access via division leads?  
- How do we capture faculty feedback to refine match weights over time?
