## User Story 003 â€“ Pre-Award Specialist Runs Command-Line Tool

**Role**: Pre-Award Staff Specialist  
**Need**: Execute the matching tool twice yearly via command line using provided keyword spreadsheets, and deliver faculty-ready opportunity lists.  
**Benefit**: Replace time-consuming manual searches with a consistent process that surfaces both obvious and nuanced matches.

### Narrative
As a Pre-Award staff member, I want clear instructions and a forgiving command-line workflow so I can load division keyword spreadsheets, generate tailored opportunity lists, and share results with faculty without fearing mistakes.

### Problem Today
- No existing tool; compiling opportunities per faculty manually is unmanageable.  
- Standard web searches miss nuanced keyword overlaps.  
- Results vary with staff workload, leading to inconsistent coverage over time.

### Success Signals
- Staff can complete a full run across all divisions without assistance.  
- Output includes faculty career stage and match rationale, ready for distribution.  
- Subtle keyword matches appear alongside obvious ones, demonstrating added value.  
- Staff report confidence in repeating the process each cycle.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Command-line interface accepts faculty and foundation keyword Excel files and validates inputs.  
2. Tool generates per-division outputs listing opportunities grouped by faculty and career stage.  
3. Run documentation guides staff through setup, execution, and troubleshooting.  
4. Error messages and logs are human-readable, indicating how to correct issues.  
5. Outputs export in a format easily shared with faculty or division chiefs (e.g., Excel/CSV).

### Open Questions
- Should the first release include a dry-run mode to preview matches before final export?  
- What training or onboarding material best supports staff unfamiliar with command-line tools?
