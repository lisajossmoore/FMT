## User Story 001 â€“ Department Chair Wants Targeted Funding Leads

**Role**: Department Chair, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah  
**Need**: Ensure faculty receive twice-yearly, experience-tuned foundation opportunity lists that prompt consistent submissions.  
**Benefit**: Boost overall foundation submissions, bring first-time applicants into the pipeline, and sustain funding wins for seasoned faculty despite federal headwinds.

### Narrative
As the department chair, I want curated foundation funding opportunities delivered directly to faculty twice yearly, so that both experienced and novice investigators pursue aligned grants without sifting through irrelevant mailers.

### Problem Today
- No systematic keyword-to-foundation matching exists.  
- University-wide mailers overwhelm faculty with unfocused opportunities.  
- New investigators remain unaware of foundation partners suited to their work.

### Success Signals
- Pre-Award Office reports a higher volume of foundation submissions across the faculty.  
- Faculty who have never applied before submit proposals after receiving the lists.  
- Experienced investigators maintain or grow their funding levels despite a difficult federal environment.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Tool produces biannual faculty-specific opportunity lists with adjustable match strictness per faculty member.  
2. Pre-Award Office can produce submission summaries (outside the tool) that demonstrate increased participation to the chair.  
3. Each opportunity is traceable to the keywords that triggered the match for audit and refinement.  
4. Output is formatted for immediate distribution to the Pre-Award Office and division chiefs without manual cleanup.

### Open Questions
- Preferred delivery channel for the chair (dashboard, secure email, shared drive?).  
- Additional metrics to highlight beyond submission counts (awards, conversion rates, etc.)?
